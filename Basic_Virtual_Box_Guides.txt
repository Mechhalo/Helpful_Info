Setting up the vm
(Ill get to this later...)


Setting up Guest Editions on the Guest Machine
1) Boot up and log into Guest Machine
2) Open Terminal
3) Enter the following 3 lines, let the command finish before typing each line

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install build-essential


-You will need to type your password when doing this
-This will update the list of repositories and dependencies
-Then install all changes
-After that it will grab the package 'build-essential' and install it

4) In the Virtual Box Menu, navigate to 'Devices' and at the bottom select 'Insert Guest Additions CD image...'
5) A pop up should appear asking if you would like to run the software on the cd select yes
-If you did not get a pop up, check that that Ubuntu currently detects a cd in the disk drive. If not try step 4 again, also try giving the Guest OS a restart.
6) When it is finished installing the Guest Additions, give the Guest OS a restart.


Shared Clipboard
1) Make sure you have Guest Editions installed on the Guest OS (follow instructions above)
2) Select the Guest OS and Boot
3) Under the menu 'Devices' and 'Shared Clipboard' you can change which directions you would like the Clipboard to go between.



Set up a Shared Folder
1) Make sure you have Guest Editions installed on the Guest OS (follow instructions above)
2) On the Guest OS, open Terminal and run the following line:

sudo adduser <USERNAME HERE> vboxsf

-Replace <USERNAME HERE> with the username of the Guest OS that you are using

3) When that is finished shutdown the Guest OS
4) Navigate to Virtual Box, select the Guest OS and enter the settings
5) Under 'Shared Folders' select Machine Folders and hit the "Folder with a green plus sign" button
6) Select the drop down on the right of 'Folder Path' and select 'Other', select the folder to use on the Host Machine
7) Select 'Auto-mount', this will tell the guest to try to mount the folder on start up
8) Boot the Guest OS
9) In the file explorer you should see a directory in 'media' named sf_<Host_Folder> where <Host_Folder> is the name of the host folder you selected to share
